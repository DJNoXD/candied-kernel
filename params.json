If the ROM you use is cyanogen 7 or based on it there should be no problems.\r\nI guess it should work with every gb rom, but there is no guarantee.\r\n\r\nIf you use a gingerbread ROM which is not based on cyanogen, feel free to test yourself (Create a backup, flash kernel and test it) and share your result with us. \r\n\r\n## How do I install the kernel?\r\n* Reboot to Recovery\r\n* Choose: install zip from sdcard -> choose zip from sdcard\r\n* Select the kernel zip file\r\n* wipe cache and dalvik cache (not a must but I recommend)\r\n* Reboot (if kernel is successful installed)\r\n\r\n## Why is advanced routing included?\r\nSome VPN apps need advanced routing features to work completely.\r\n\r\n## Could you include ...?\r\nTell me what you like to see and if possible the sources.\r\nI will take a look at and decide if it can be included. (and if I want to)\r\n\r\n## I found an error. / I have a problem. What can I do?\r\nPost your problem at [xda-developers](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1587209).\r\nIf you are using my kernels on other ROMs than cyanogen or with older android versions, please keep in mind that your ROM is maybe incompatible with this kernel.\r\n\r\n## Example battery usage of my phone\r\nThe hard drops happen while using date (mostly with wlan) or running some benchmark.\r\n![battery consumption](http://img.tapatalk.com/02ce0008-c977-1fc7.jpg)\r\n\r\n#explanation of the abbreviations\r\n* vsync = vsync enabled\r\n* vsyncOff = vsync disabled\r\n*
